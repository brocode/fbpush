* fbpush

** Installation
   After git clone,

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   sudo dotcopter dotcopter.yml apply
   #+END_SRC

   which will create a symlink in ~/usr/local/bin~

** Usage

   After pushing stuff in your repo, do

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   fbpush my-branch-name
   #+END_SRC

   This will:
   * create a branch named ~my-branch-name~ and switch to it
   * push that branch to the origin remote
   * create a pull request on GitHub
   * wait until the CI status of the ~HEAD~ becomes green (it will crash if you don't have CI set up)
   * Open the pull request page so you can click on merge
   * Delete the local branch and drop you back on master
