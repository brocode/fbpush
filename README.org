* fbpush

  Want to push some code in a cool project that has mandatory pull requests with mandatory CI set up (that rocks!)?
  Wish you could "just push" assuming all goes well?
  Have a huge number of repositories and want to make a small change to a lot of them?

  Look no further, ~fbpush~ will automate (almost) all the pain away.

** Installation
   After git clone,

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   sudo dotcopter dotcopter.yml apply
   #+END_SRC

   which will create a symlink in ~/usr/local/bin~

** Usage

   After pushing stuff in your repo, do

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   fbpush my-branch-name
   #+END_SRC

   This will:
   * create a branch named ~my-branch-name~ and switch to it
   * push that branch to the origin remote
   * create a pull request on GitHub
   * wait until the CI status of the ~HEAD~ becomes green (it will crash if you don't have CI set up)
   * Open the pull request page so you can click on merge
   * Delete the local branch and drop you back on master

** Hot tips
   Use with [[https://github.com/brocode/fw][fw foreach]] for best results (foreach supports backpressure with ~-p N)~
